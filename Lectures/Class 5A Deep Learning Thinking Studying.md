## Learn how to do Deep Research

### General Best Practices for Prompts



To get the most out of Deep Research mode, students should craft precise and structured prompts:

- **Assume a Role:** Frame the query as a task for a specific audience. For example, "Draft a memorandum for a law firm's technology committee..." or "Prepare an analysis for a corporate board of directors..."
- **Request Nuance:** Ask for competing arguments, policy implications, or different jurisdictional approaches. For example, "...include a discussion of the policy arguments for and against this approach."
- **Demand Structure:** Specify the exact sections you want in the output. This forces the AI to organize the information logically and makes the output more useful as a research outline. Provide a suggested word count. Optionally, request an output format such as Markdown or LaTeX.

### Exercises on Contemporary Legal Topics



Students can choose one or more of the following exercises based on their coursework and interests. If you are not currently enrolled in any of these courses, or if you simply prefer to do so, pick your own legal topic for Deep Research.  You should give the query to both ChatGPT Deep Research and Gemini Deep Research and compare responses.



#### 1. Evidence



- **Exercise Title:** Admitting AI-Generated Evidence at Trial

- **Objective:** To analyze the significant evidentiary challenges presented by evidence created or modified by generative AI and to develop a framework for arguing for or against its admissibility.

- **The Task:** Students will explore the frontier of digital evidence rules by mapping the hurdles for admitting a piece of AI-generated content, such as an accident reconstruction video or a deepfake audio recording.

- Prompt for Deep Research Mode:

  "Generate a legal memorandum analyzing the challenges of admitting evidence created by a generative AI model in a U.S. federal court. Structure the analysis around the Federal Rules of Evidence, including the following sections:

  1. Introduction to the types of AI-generated evidence (e.g., photorealistic images, audio, video reconstructions).
  2. Authentication challenges under FRE 901: How can a proponent establish that the evidence is what they claim it is? Discuss the 'black box' problem of AI.
  3. Hearsay analysis under FRE 801/802: Is AI-generated output a 'statement' by a 'declarant'? Analyze arguments on both sides.
  4. Application of the *Daubert* standard under FRE 702: Should the underlying AI model be treated as a scientific technique that requires expert testimony and validation?
  5. Balancing probative value against unfair prejudice under FRE 403, especially regarding highly realistic or inflammatory deepfakes.
  6. Conclusion summarizing a potential framework or checklist for a court to use."

- **Follow-Up Analysis:**

  1. Using the generated memo as a guide, find one recent law review article on AI and the rules of evidence using a database like HeinOnline.
  2. Does the article raise an issue or a nuance that Gemini's overview missed?
  3. Draft a short motion *in limine* (a pre-trial motion to exclude evidence) arguing against the admissibility of an AI-generated accident reconstruction, using the framework from the Gemini output and your additional research.



#### 2. Federal Income Tax



- **Exercise Title:** The Evolving Tax Treatment of Cryptocurrency

- **Objective:** To synthesize the current state of U.S. federal income tax law regarding digital assets, an area governed more by IRS guidance than by statute or established case law.

- **The Task:** Students will create a comprehensive guide to the tax consequences of various cryptocurrency transactions for an individual taxpayer.

- Prompt for Deep Research Mode:

  "Prepare a detailed client advisory letter explaining the U.S. federal income tax treatment of cryptocurrency transactions. The letter must be based on current IRS notices and guidance. Organize it as follows:

  1. Introduction: Explanation that the IRS treats cryptocurrency as property, not currency.

  2. Taxable Events: A clear breakdown of transactions that trigger tax consequences, including:

     a. Selling crypto for fiat currency.

     b. Trading one crypto for another.

     c. Using crypto to pay for goods and services.

     d. Receiving crypto as income from mining or staking.

  3. Character of Gain or Loss: Explain how to determine whether gains are short-term or long-term capital gains under ยง1221.

  4. Specific Scenarios: Address the tax treatment of more complex events like airdrops and hard forks, referencing IRS Revenue Ruling 2019-24.

  5. Information Reporting: Briefly explain the current requirements for reporting crypto on Form 1040 and the role of Form 1099-DA from brokers.

  6. Conclusion and Disclaimer: Summarize key takeaways and include a standard disclaimer."

- **Follow-Up Analysis:**

  1. Locate the primary IRS source document referenced in the prompt, such as Notice 2014-21 or Revenue Ruling 2019-24, on the IRS website.
  2. Read the original guidance. Does Gemini's summary accurately reflect the official position? Is there any ambiguity in the IRS document that Gemini's simplified explanation smoothed over?
  3. Identify one question the IRS guidance does *not* clearly answer (e.g., the tax treatment of wrapping a token or liquidity pool staking rewards).



#### 3. Professional Responsibility



- **Exercise Title:** Crafting a Law Firm Policy on Generative AI

- **Objective:** To apply the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct to the novel challenges presented by lawyers' use of generative AI tools like ChatGPT or Gemini.

- **The Task:** Students will act as a junior partner on a law firm's ethics committee, tasked with drafting the foundation of a firm-wide policy on using AI.

- Prompt for Deep Research Mode:

  "Draft a memorandum to a law firm's management committee outlining the key ethical issues to address in a new firm policy on the use of generative AI in legal practice. The memo should analyze the issues through the lens of the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct:

  1. Rule 1.1 (Competence): The duty to understand the benefits and risks of relevant technology.
  2. Rule 1.6 (Confidentiality): The risk of inputting confidential client information into third-party AI platforms.
  3. Rule 5.1 & 5.3 (Supervision): The duty of partners and supervising attorneys to ensure associates and staff use AI responsibly.
  4. Rule 3.3 (Candor Toward the Tribunal) & Rule 8.4 (Misconduct): The duty to verify AI-generated legal citations and avoid submitting 'hallucinated' cases, referencing the *Mata v. Avianca Airlines* sanctions.
  5. Rule 1.5 (Fees): The ethical considerations of billing clients for work performed by an AI.
  6. Recommendations for a draft policy, including mandatory training, approved vendor lists, and disclosure requirements."

- **Follow-Up Analysis:**

  1. The ABA Model Rules are a template. Law is regulated at the state level. Find a recent ethics opinion on the use of AI from a specific state bar association (e.g., Florida, California, or New York).
  2. Compare the state's specific guidance to the general framework provided by Gemini. Does the state opinion impose stricter or more specific requirements?
  3. Rewrite the "Recommendations" section of the memo to be compliant with that specific state's ethics opinion.



#### 4. Business Organizations



- **Exercise Title:** ESG, Fiduciary Duties, and the Business Judgment Rule

- **Objective:** To analyze the tension between the traditional shareholder-primacy model of corporate governance and the modern push for corporations to consider Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors.

- **The Task:** Students will advise a corporate board on how to approach ESG initiatives without violating their fiduciary duties to the corporation and its shareholders.

- Prompt for Deep Research Mode:

  "Prepare a memorandum for the Board of Directors of a Delaware corporation explaining how ESG considerations interact with traditional fiduciary duties of care and loyalty. Please structure the memo as follows:

  1. Executive Summary of the issue.
  2. The Shareholder Primacy Norm: Briefly explain the traditional view, referencing foundational cases like *Dodge \ v. \ Ford \ Motor \ Co.*
  3. The Business Judgment Rule: Explain how this deferential standard gives directors wide latitude in making business decisions.
  4. Framing ESG as Long-Term Value Creation: Analyze the argument that considering stakeholder interests (employees, community, environment) is essential for the long-term profitability and risk management of the corporation, making it consistent with shareholder primacy.
  5. The 'Constituency Statute' and B-Corp Alternatives: Briefly mention how some jurisdictions have statutorily allowed directors to consider non-shareholder interests.
  6. Risk Analysis: Discuss the potential for shareholder derivative lawsuits alleging that a board's ESG-motivated decision wasted corporate assets or was a breach of the duty of loyalty (citing the *Caremark* standard for oversight failure, if relevant).
  7. Practical Recommendations for the Board to mitigate legal risk when pursuing ESG goals."

- **Follow-Up Analysis:**

  1. Gemini's output will discuss the general legal landscape. Find a recent shareholder derivative lawsuit that was actually filed against a company's board related to an ESG issue (e.g., a lawsuit over failures in diversity initiatives or climate change disclosures).
  2. Read a news article or a law firm's client alert about the lawsuit's core allegations.
  3. Does the real-world lawsuit reflect the theoretical risks outlined in the Gemini-generated memorandum? How would the memo's recommendations have helped the board in that specific case?

### Query
Here is a query. Run it on ChatGPT in "Instant Mode" and then, in a separate chat, in "Thinking Mode." See what differences you notice in the output. 

> Congress passes the Federal Data Integrity Act (FDIA), which creates an Independent National Data Board (NDB). The NDBโs job is to adjudicate disputes involving the accuracy of data held by federal agencies (think Social Security earnings records, census counts, and veteransโ benefit histories).
> 
> The statute provides that the NDBโs five members are appointed by the President, confirmed by the Senate, and may be removed only for โgross negligence or corruption.โ
> 
> The NDB is authorized to issue binding orders on agencies and award monetary adjustments to individuals (e.g., correcting benefits owed).
> 
> Congress provides that all NDB proceedings will be โin lieu of judicial review,โ with only a limited appeal to the D.C. Circuit on questions of law.
> 
> Finally, the statute bars nationwide or universal injunctions against the NDB, limiting courts to party-specific relief.
> 
> A group of individuals brings suit after their benefits are wrongly denied by the NDB. They raise three claims:

1. The removal restriction violates Seila Law and the Presidentโs Article II authority.
1. The NDBโs power to award money damages without juries violates the Seventh Amendment.
1. The ban on universal injunctions is inconsistent with Article III and traditional equitable principles.

### Assignment

You are a law clerk evaluating these claims. Your judge wants a carefully thought through response that takes into account the most recent Supreme Court cases and contains accurate and bluebooked citations to the important precedents. The judge wants a 2000 word memo.
