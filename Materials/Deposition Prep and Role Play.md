**Video Quality and Authentication:**

## Defendant's Position

**Thompson Construction Company Claims:**
- All safety measures were in compliance with OSHA standards
- Regular safety inspections conducted
- Scaffolding was properly installed and maintained
- Suggests Martinez may have staged or exaggerated incident
- Points to surveillance evidence as proof of fraudulent claims
- Notes inconsistency between claimed disability and observed activities

**Expert Witness Preparation:**
- Construction safety expert prepared to testify about proper procedures
- Medical expert ready to opine that Martinez's disc bulging likely pre-existing
- Vocational rehabilitation expert to dispute claims of permanent disability

## Plaintiff's Challenges

**Problematic Elements:**
- Surveillance video directly contradicts disability claims
- Medical findings are relatively minor compared to claimed symptoms
- Gap between subjective complaints and objective medical evidence
- Prior medical records show Martinez treated for back pain in 2019 (chiropractor visits)
- No independent witnesses to actual moment of impact

**Potential Explanations Needed:**
- How Martinez can play basketball despite claimed 8/10 pain levels
- Why she hasn't sought employment in sedentary positions
- Reconciling surveillance evidence with medical testimony
- Addressing credibility issues raised by contradictory evidence
