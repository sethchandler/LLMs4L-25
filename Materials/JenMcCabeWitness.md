Statement Taken By: Detective Michael Proctor, Massachusetts State Police
Case Number: [Redacted]

I, Jennifer McCabe, provide the following statement voluntarily to the Massachusetts State Police regarding the events of January 28 and 29, 2022, involving John O’Keefe and Karen Read. I understand this statement is given under penalty of perjury and is part of an official investigation.

On the evening of January 28, 2022, my husband, Matthew McCabe, and I were invited to join friends at the Waterfall Bar & Grill in Canton, Massachusetts, to celebrate a mutual friend’s birthday. We arrived around 9:00 p.m. and met with several people, including John O’Keefe, a Boston Police officer and close friend, and his girlfriend, Karen Read. Others present included Brian Albert, Nicole Albert, and a few other mutual acquaintances. The atmosphere was social, with drinks and conversation. I observed John and Karen interacting; they appeared to be in good spirits, though I noticed Karen was drinking wine at a steady pace. I myself had one or two drinks over the course of the evening but remained sober.

Around 11:30 p.m., the group decided to continue the gathering at Brian and Nicole Albert’s home at 34 Fairview Road in Canton. Brian invited several people, including John and Karen, to join. My husband and I drove separately in our vehicle, arriving at the Alberts’ residence shortly after midnight. John and Karen were to follow in Karen’s black Lexus SUV. When we arrived, we parked in the driveway, and other guests began arriving shortly after. The gathering took place in the Alberts’ living room, where people were talking, listening to music, and having drinks. I recall seeing Brian and Nicole Albert, their nephew Colin Albert, Brian Higgins, and a few others present.

At approximately 12:45 a.m. on January 29, 2022, I stepped outside to the front porch to make a phone call, as it was quieter there. While outside, I noticed a black SUV, which I recognized as Karen Read’s vehicle, parked on the street near the Alberts’ house, close to the flagpole in their front yard. The vehicle was stationary, and I could not see inside due to the darkness and distance. I did not see John O’Keefe or anyone else outside at that time. I returned inside after a few minutes and did not think much of it, assuming John and Karen might have been delayed or decided not to join us. John never arrived at the Alberts’ home that night, and I did not see him after we left the Waterfall Bar.

The gathering at the Alberts’ continued until around 1:30 a.m., when my husband and I decided to head home. We drove back to our residence, which is a short distance away, and went to bed. I was not aware of any issues or incidents at that time.

On the morning of January 29, 2022, at approximately 4:30 a.m., I received a phone call from Karen Read. She sounded frantic and upset, asking if I had seen John or knew where he was. She said she couldn’t find him and that they had a fight the previous night. I told her I hadn’t seen John since the bar and suggested she check places he might have gone, like his home. Karen mentioned she was driving around and sounded increasingly agitated. She asked me to come help her look for John, saying she was near the Alberts’ house. Concerned for her state of mind, I agreed to meet her.

I drove back to 34 Fairview Road, arriving around 5:00 a.m. Karen was already there, parked in her SUV on the street. She was visibly distressed, crying, and appeared disheveled. She kept repeating, “Where is he? I can’t find him.” I tried to calm her down and suggested we look around the area. It was snowing lightly, and the ground was covered with a few inches of snow from earlier in the night. As we walked near the Alberts’ front yard, Karen suddenly screamed and pointed to a spot near the flagpole. I looked and saw a body lying in the snow, partially covered. I recognized the clothing as John O’Keefe’s from the night before.

I immediately called 911 at approximately 5:15 a.m. while Karen was screaming and crying beside me. She kept saying, “I hit him, I hit him,” which I assumed was her expressing guilt or panic about their earlier argument. I focused on giving the dispatcher clear information about our location and John’s condition. He appeared unresponsive, and I could see some blood on his face and head. I did not touch him, as I was in shock and waiting for emergency services.

While waiting for the police and paramedics, Karen was pacing and talking rapidly. She said things like, “This is my fault,” and “What did I do?” I tried to comfort her but was focused on the situation. At one point, she asked me to look up something on my phone. She said, “Can you Google how long it takes to die in the cold?” I was taken aback but opened my phone and typed the query into Google to calm her down. The search was made around 5:20 a.m., and I showed her the results, which indicated hypothermia could set in within hours depending on conditions. I did not think much of it at the time, as I assumed she was worried about John being outside.

Police and paramedics arrived shortly after, around 5:30 a.m. They began attending to John, and I stepped back to give them space. Karen was taken aside by officers, and I gave a brief initial statement to a responding officer about finding John. Matthew and I then went to the hospital to check on John’s status, where we learned he had been pronounced deceased. Karen was at the hospital, still emotional, and repeated statements like, “I hit him,” to me and others present, including John’s friend Kerry Roberts. I understood these as expressions of guilt, possibly related to their argument or her driving that night.

Throughout the night and morning, I did not witness any altercations or suspicious activity at the Alberts’ home. The gathering was a typical social event, and no one mentioned any issues with John or Karen. I have known John for many years through my sister-in-law, Nicole Albert, and he was a kind, responsible person. I am unaware of any reason anyone would want to harm him. Karen and John’s relationship, from what I observed, had occasional tensions, but I did not witness anything specific that night beyond her drinking and their brief interactions at the bar.

I provided my phone to investigators later that day to review call logs and the Google search mentioned above. I have not altered or deleted any information related to this incident. I am willing to cooperate fully with the investigation and provide any additional details as needed. This statement reflects my honest recollection of the events to the best of my ability.

Signed,
Jennifer McCabe

##Impeachment material

Below are five items used to impeach Jennifer McCabe’s testimony in the Karen Read homicide trial, based on her role as a key prosecution witness and the defense’s efforts to challenge her credibility. Each item includes how McCabe reacted when confronted, drawn from trial coverage and her responses under cross-examination. The response is concise, targeting approximately 600 words, and focuses on specific inconsistencies or evidence used to undermine her statements.

1. **Google Search Timing and Deletion**  
   **Impeachment Item**: The defense highlighted a Google search on McCabe’s phone at 2:27 a.m. on January 29, 2022, for “how long to die in cold,” which they claimed was made before John O’Keefe’s body was found and later deleted to cover up knowledge of his condition. This contradicted McCabe’s claim that the search occurred around 5:20 a.m. at Read’s request.  
   **McCabe’s Reaction**: Under cross-examination, McCabe firmly denied conducting or deleting the 2:27 a.m. search, insisting the only relevant search was made later in Read’s presence. She appeared defensive, emphasizing her cooperation with police by providing her phone and denying any manipulation. McCabe maintained the earlier search was a fabrication or misunderstanding, though she grew visibly flustered when pressed on forensic evidence suggesting data deletion.

2. **Inconsistent Timeline of Seeing Read’s SUV**  
   **Impeachment Item**: McCabe testified she saw Read’s SUV parked near the Alberts’ home around 12:45 a.m., but the defense pointed to discrepancies in her initial police statement versus trial testimony, noting variations in the exact time and her actions (e.g., whether she lingered outside). They suggested she fabricated this observation to align with the prosecution’s timeline.  
   **McCabe’s Reaction**: McCabe stood by her account, clarifying that her memory of the SUV’s position was consistent despite minor timeline variations due to the chaotic night. She appeared composed but slightly irritated, reiterating that she had no reason to lie about seeing the vehicle. Her responses aimed to downplay inconsistencies as minor recall errors.

3. **Relationship with Brian Albert and Potential Bias**  
   **Impeachment Item**: The defense questioned McCabe’s objectivity due to her familial ties to Brian Albert (her brother-in-law), whose home was the site of the after-party and a focus of the defense’s cover-up theory. They suggested her testimony was influenced to protect Albert and others.  
   **McCabe’s Reaction**: McCabe denied any bias, asserting her loyalty was to the truth and her friendship with O’Keefe. She became emotional, emphasizing her grief over O’Keefe’s death and rejecting accusations of a cover-up. Her tone was indignant when pressed on Albert’s involvement, insisting no one at the party harmed O’Keefe.

4. **Alleged Admissions by Read**  
   **Impeachment Item**: McCabe claimed Read repeatedly said, “I hit him,” but the defense challenged the context and timing, noting that other witnesses, like first responders, did not hear these statements clearly or attributed them to Read’s distress, not a confession. They argued McCabe exaggerated or misconstrued Read’s words.  
   **McCabe’s Reaction**: McCabe was adamant that Read made the statements clearly and repeatedly, both at the scene and hospital. She grew frustrated under cross-examination, insisting she had no motive to misrepresent Read’s words. Her demeanor suggested confidence in her recollection but agitation when the defense implied she tailored her testimony to fit the prosecution’s narrative.

5. **Phone Call Records and Contact with Proctor**  
   **Impeachment Item**: The defense presented phone records showing multiple calls between McCabe and lead investigator Michael Proctor, suggesting coordination to shape the narrative. They argued this undermined her claim of being an impartial witness.  
   **McCabe’s Reaction**: McCabe acknowledged speaking with Proctor but maintained these were routine follow-ups for the investigation. She appeared defensive, clarifying that her contact was solely to assist police, not to influence the case. When pressed on the frequency of calls, she deflected, stating she couldn’t recall every detail but denied any improper coordination.

**Summary**: McCabe’s reactions varied from composed to defensive and emotional, reflecting her central role and the intense scrutiny she faced. The defense’s strategy focused on portraying her as biased or untruthful, leveraging forensic discrepancies and her connections to law enforcement. Her responses aimed to reinforce her credibility, though she struggled when confronted with technical evidence like phone data. (Word count: ~580)
