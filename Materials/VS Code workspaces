# Understanding VS Code Workspaces

When you open Visual Studio Code, you might assume it can access any file on your computer. **It cannot.** VS Code can only read and write files in folders you've explicitly added to your **workspace**.

## What Is a Workspace?

A workspace is essentially a **permission list**. It tells VS Code (and its extensions) which folders they're allowed to touch. Everything else on your computer is off-limits. This protects your system from buggy or malicious extensions.

Think of it as a security boundary, not just an organizational feature.

## How to See Your Workspace

Look at the **Explorer panel** on the left sidebar. The folders listed there (often under a section like "UNTITLED" or your project name) are your workspace. These are the only directories VS Code can access.

## How to Modify Your Workspace

**To add a folder:**
- Right-click in the Explorer panel
- Select "Add Folder to Workspace..."
- Navigate to the folder and click "Add"

**To remove a folder:**
- Right-click the folder name in Explorer
- Select "Remove Folder from Workspace"

If extensions complain about "read-only" access or can't find files, you probably need to add the relevant folder to your workspace first.
