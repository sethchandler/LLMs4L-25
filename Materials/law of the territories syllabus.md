# Course Title: The Insular Cases and Constitutional Law of U.S. Territories

## Course Description
This course examines the constitutional framework governing U.S. territories—Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Northern Mariana Islands—through the lens of the Insular Cases, a series of Supreme Court decisions from 1901 to 1922 that established the doctrine of territorial incorporation. These cases legitimized U.S. imperialism by creating a distinction between "incorporated" and "unincorporated" territories, limiting the full application of the Constitution in the latter. Students will explore historical contexts, key legal doctrines, and contemporary implications, including congressional plenary power, equal protection, citizenship rights, and the racist underpinnings of the inherent powers doctrine. The course addresses why this area remains obscure in legal education, as highlighted by the American Bar Association's Resolution 300 (2021), which urges law schools to incorporate these topics to address structural inequalities. By analyzing primary cases, secondary scholarship, and policy debates, participants will critically assess how the U.S. Constitution applies selectively to territories and consider pathways for reform.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the historical origins of U.S. territorial expansion and the role of the Insular Cases in shaping constitutional exceptionalism.
- Analyze core doctrines like territorial incorporation, plenary power under the Territorial Clause (U.S. Const. art. IV, § 3, cl. 2), and the selective application of constitutional rights.
- Evaluate the implications for citizenship, equal protection, and democratic theory in territories.
- Critique the racist foundations of these doctrines and their persistence in modern jurisprudence.
- Explore contemporary issues, such as territorial voting rights, economic disparities, and proposals for statehood or independence.
- Develop skills in constitutional interpretation through case analysis, simulations, and policy discussions.

## Prerequisites
Basic familiarity with U.S. Constitutional Law (e.g., a prior course covering federalism, due process, and equal protection). No prior knowledge of territorial law is required.
